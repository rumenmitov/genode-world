	This is initial port of golang to genode
	========================================
This work is a side result of one of the research project made in Innopolis University.
	(c) Alex Tormasov, tor@innopolis.ru - port itsels, Alexey Semenov aleks.semenov@innopolis.ru - build

It allow compilation and execution of simple go applications/packages (without unsupported OS/platform features).
In this moment it supports nova and sel4 kernels on x86 platform.

I use only gccgo version of golang compiler. Things like "go build" in cross mode not supported yet (while we make
some techology to produce makefiles from "go build" to compilei go code, not attached yet).
Other limitations see below.

It build a set of libraries, from world repo, as static ones.
Also it build a set of standard golang packages (namely fmt, os, syscall, runtime/etc) as files for gccgo compilation.
Note: Go runtinme support around 9 systems as backend. I use netbsd as simplest one as the base for new system - "inno".

To implement context switching I have to port it from the glibc (but use makecontext from genode FreeBSD port, so, to use
you need to fill mc_len field before call to makecontext()); for stack it use alloc_secondary_stack() from Genode.

	Installation instruction
	========================
0. setup genode on appropriate platform using https://github.com/tor-m6/genode.git and https://github.com/tor-m6/genode-world.git, 
configure toolchain and prepare  code to compile, setup environment, e.g. (replace by your own dirs):
	export PATH=/usr/local/genode/tool/current/bin:/media/psf/Home/gen/20.05/build/tool_chain-19.05/install/bin:$PATH
	export AS=genode-x86-as
	export LD=genode-x86-ld
	export GDB=genode-x86-gdb
	export STRIP=genode-x86-stripexport 
	export RANLIB=genode-x86-ranlib
	export OBJCOPY=genode-x86-objcopy
	export OBJDUMP=genode-x86-objdump
	export READELF=genode-x86-readelf
	export AR=genode-x86-ar
	export NM=genode-x86-gcc-nm
   add to begining of build/x86_64/etc/build.conf something like (correct dirs):
	GENODE_DIR  := <your genode dir>
	BASE_DIR    := $(GENODE_DIR)/repos/base
	CONTRIB_DIR := $(GENODE_DIR)/contrib

	# toolchain prefix
	export CROSS_DEV_PREFIX:=/usr/local/genode/tool/current/bin/genode-x86-
	# compiler for GO
	export GOC := /usr/local/genode/tool/current/bin/genode-x86-gccgo
	...
   and finally cd to genode dir
1. prepare ports from genode, e.g. by
	./tool/ports/prepare_port libc nova x86emu stdcxx grub2
2. prepare ports to build golang libgo from gcc distirbution
	./tool/ports/prepare_port libatomic libbacktrace libffi libgo
3. build native libraries (set your own flags if need, eg -O) for genode (libgo should be the last) by
	make -C build/x86_64/ KERNEL=nova CFLAGS="-g -O0" lib/libatomic
	make -C build/x86_64/ KERNEL=nova CFLAGS="-g -O0" lib/libbacktrace
	make -C build/x86_64/ KERNEL=nova CFLAGS="-g -O0" lib/libffi
	make -C build/x86_64/ KERNEL=nova CFLAGS="-g -O0" lib/libgo
4. build and run test go application by
	make -C build/x86_64/ KERNEL=nova CFLAGS="-g -O0" run/go_app

target.mk for test app:

TARGET = test-go
SRC_GO = main.go

LIBS   = base stdcxx libc libm libgo libgo_support mcontext-support

# add place where compiled packages appears
CUSTOM_GO = /usr/local/genode/tool/19.05/bin/genode-x86-gccgo -B$(BUILD_BASE_DIR)/lib/libgo

TOOL_PATH:=$(dir $(GOC))

LD_CMD = /usr/local/genode/tool/19.05/bin/genode-x86-gcc -B ${TOOL_PATH}/x86/gcc/gcc/

# libraries to be add in the end of link/ld command
# order is important; problem in correct initializers order for different so libs for Env
LD_LIBGCC = \
${LIB_CACHE_DIR}/base-$(KERNEL)-common/base-$(KERNEL)-common.lib.a \
${LIB_CACHE_DIR}/startup-$(KERNEL)/startup-$(KERNEL).lib.a \

	Configuration after build
	=========================
Golang package (like fmt) is an object file (e.g. fmt.o) which appears in build/x86_64/lib/libgo/ directory and
subdirectories. This path should be included during golang/gccgo compilation (not only linking). Built libraries for Go
will be in ${BUILD_BASE_DIR}/lib/libgo/libgobegin.a ${BUILD_BASE_DIR}/lib/libgo/libgolibbegin.a and 
${BUILD_BASE_DIR}/lib/libgo/.libs/libgo.a


Sequnce of libraries in target.mk is important, otherwise you can hit problem that libc heap initialization in libc.lib.so
does not happens because some statical constructors (malloc heap init) do not called in proper order.

	Debugging
	=========
On most systems (like seL4) you can use only debug print, and sometimes print locking (and output) is tricky.
You can use gdb to debug your application on nova (while gdb support in genode somehow limited, I found a lot of problems
with improper breaks/etc); I use Parallels VM or qemu on Mac. To compile code for gdb please, take a look at
repos/world/run/go_app_dbg.run. For convenience I add my VSCode launch.json (to run debugger using VSCode as frontend):
        {
            "type": "gdb",
            "request": "attach",
            "name": "Attach to qemu",
            "gdbpath": "/usr/local/genode/tool/current/bin/genode-x86-gdb",
            "executable": "build/x86_64/var/libcache/ld-nova/ld-nova.lib.so",
            "target": ":5555",
            "remote": true,
            "cwd": "/var/services/homes/admin/gen/21.02",
            "autorun": [
                "set output-radix 16",
                "set solib-search-path build/x86_64/debug",
                "file build/x86_64/var/libcache/ld-nova/ld-nova.lib.so",
                "b binary_ready_hook_for_gdb",
                "c",
                "delete 1",
                "file build/x86_64/debug/test-go",
                "add-symbol-file build/x86_64/debug/ld-nova.lib.so",
                "add-symbol-file build/x86_64/debug/libc.lib.so -o 0x10dfe000",
                "add-symbol-file build/x86_64/debug/libm.lib.so -o 0x10d28000",
                "add-symbol-file build/x86_64/debug/vfs.lib.so -o 0x10d62000",
                "add-symbol-file build/x86_64/debug/stdcxx.lib.so -o 0x1310000",
                "b main",
                "sharedlibrary"
            ],
            "valuesFormatting": "parseText"
        }

Addresses like -o 0x10dfe000 you could take from log of program after first start, e.g.

[init -> gdb_monitor -> test-go]   0x1000000 .. 0x10ffffff: linker area
[init -> gdb_monitor -> test-go]   0x40000000 .. 0x4fffffff: stack area
[init -> gdb_monitor -> test-go]   0x30000 .. 0x161fff: ld.lib.so
[init -> gdb_monitor -> test-go]   0x10dfe000 .. 0x10ffffff: libc.lib.so
[init -> gdb_monitor -> test-go]   0x10d62000 .. 0x10dfdfff: vfs.lib.so
[init -> gdb_monitor -> test-go]   0x10d28000 .. 0x10d61fff: libm.lib.so
[init -> gdb_monitor -> test-go]   0x1310000 .. 0x14c7fff: stdcxx.lib.so


	Current limitations
	===================
  -	can run in VM with 1 CPU only:
	in general it support checking of CPU number (by backporting patch from current genode code) and trying to run
	everything, but it hangs somewhere in the middle due to recursive locking (error "deadlock ahead" in acquire() in mutex.cc)
		May be this is small mistake - don't have time to find and fix (in this place due to slot_jump() gdb do not give
		normal info related to stack). I found that problem during stack unwind in  ... runtime.startm -> runtime.newm -> 
		runtime.newm -> runtime.mcommoninit -> runtime.callers -> runtime_callers() -> backtrace_full() ... ;
		here it try to call strlcpy() which call _jmp_slot() and make nested Guard construction inside this function
   -	it works only on x86_64, tested on nova (not yet on sel4) kernels
	genode do not support makecontex/setcontext/gencontext family; but it is crucial to support because of goroutine model;
	I have to implement it by myself. It is machine-dependent; 
  -	during port I make a set of dirty fixes for absent on the platform (genode/nova), in particular "empty" C implementaion of
	sendfile(), getpgid(), lchown(), mount(), settimeofday(), mlock(), munlock(), mlockall(), munlockall(), sigaltstack();
	in go part of runtime port I also "damage" some functions, in particualr route.sysctl(), broke poll.ReadDirent(), do not
	use ptrace, and some others.
	See patches for libgo in repos/world/src/lib/libgo/. Anything in Golang which use them will fail.
	Potentially new genode releases will contain something which can replace or fix these and other patched functions
  -	mmap support for ANON mapping implemented do not support re-map of already allocated memory outside of made by mmap alloc
  -	once I compile all code with -O3 option, and it hangs. I did not check why...
  -	networking: never try, need to integrate with other ports, and see above about broken syscalls/routing/etc
  -	I found that my unwind lib from gcc to call standard strlen wich replaced to call via PLT@ (from shared libs).
	During exception error processing it is called from code with already taken mutex - so, deadlock, see details
